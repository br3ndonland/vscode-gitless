Git in VSCode with less bloat.

GitLess is a minimal VSCode extension for Git integration. The built-in Git features don't do enough, but other extensions do too much. GitLess provides a focused set of features for everyday Git workflows.

## Features

## Development

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 22+
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) 10+

### Setup

```sh
pnpm install
```

### Build

```sh
pnpm run build       # Production build
pnpm run build:dev   # Development build (with sourcemaps)
pnpm run watch       # Watch mode
```

### Test

```sh
pnpm run test        # Unit tests (runs in VS Code test host)
pnpm run test:e2e    # E2E tests (Playwright)
```

### Lint and Format

```sh
pnpm run lint        # Check formatting
pnpm run format      # Fix formatting
```

### Debug

Launch the Extension Development Host by pressing `F5` or running **"Debug: Start Debugging"** from the command palette. This opens a second VSCode window with the extension loaded. After making code changes, run **"Developer: Reload Window"** in the Extension Development Host to pick up the new build. See `.vscode/launch.json` for debug configurations.

### Package

```sh
pnpm run package     # Create .vsix file
```

## Publishing

Publishing is fully automated with [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release). When commits are pushed to `main`, semantic-release analyzes the commit messages to determine the next version, generates a changelog, publishes to both the [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/) and [Open VSX](https://open-vsx.org/) (for VSCodium and other non-Microsoft distributions), and creates a GitHub release.
